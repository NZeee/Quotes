## Quotes

This is a sample app to monitor quotes via WS.

Tech Stack:
* 100% Kotlin + Coroutines
* Moxy (MVP)
* Cicerone (navigation)
* Toothpick (DI)
* Room (Database)
* Web Socket

Possible roadmap:
* Using Compose for building UI;
* Interacting with the quotes table (sort, delete);
* Integratng KMP (maybe to WS managers).
